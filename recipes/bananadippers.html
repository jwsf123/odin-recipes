        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Soft bananas coated in a crispy pancake batter and served with a <em>chocolate dipping sauce</em>?
            It doesn't get much better than that!</p>
        <p>These banana dippers are delicious when served either for breakfast or as an afternoon
            snack. The <strong>slimming-friendly</strong> chocolate sauce feels super indulgent and we think that some
            sliced strawberries finish this dish off perfectly!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <h5>For the dippers:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>50g plain flour</li>
                <li>50ml skimmed milk</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 medium egg</li>
                <li>low-calorie cooking spray</li>
                <li>2 bananas</li>
                <li>1 tsp icing sugar</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>For the sauce:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>30g quark</li>
                <li>1 tbsp chocolate spread</li>
                <li>1 tsp sugar-free chocolate syrup</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol> 
                <li>To make the batter, put the flour, milk, vanilla extract and egg in a mixing bowl and whisk
                    until smooth. Set aside to rest.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl mix the quark, chocolate spread and chocolate syrup until combined. Set
                    aside until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>Spray a frying pan with low-calorie cooking spray and place over a medium heat.</li>
                <li>Slice the bananas in half and then each half lengthways into three sections. Dip each banana slice
                    into the batter mixture until coated., then place into the hot frying pan.</li>
                <li>Cook each dipper for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown in colour and a little crispy
                    round the edges.</li>
                <li>Put the dippers onto a plate and dust with icing sugar. Serve with the dipping sauce and enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
